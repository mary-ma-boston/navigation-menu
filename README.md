# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
Deployed Application: https://navigation-menu-two.vercel.app/
Bonus Points:
1. Clean and Visually Appealing Design: The navigation menu has a modern and aesthetically pleasing design, ensuring it looks great on any device.
2. Smooth Transition Effects: I have implemented smooth transition effects for the submenus, providing a polished animation for displaying and hiding them.
3. Responsive Design: The menu is fully responsive, adapting seamlessly to different screen sizes. When the screen size is less than 768px, the menu will become a hamburger icon. 
4. Icon Decoration: I have used React font awesome icons to enhance the visual appeal of the menu items, making the interface more engaging.
5. Optimized Interaction: The interaction behaviors have been fine-tuned to respond smoothly to the user's mouse movements, providing an intuitive and user-friendly experience.
6. Additional Features: To showcase my creativity and technical skills, I have added some unique features, such as keyboard navigation, adding an onKeyDown handler to toggle the submenu with the Enter or Space keys, and close it with the Escape key.
7. Used React-router-dom to enhance the accessibility and correctness of the navigation menu.
8. Improving accessibility (a11y) by using ARIA Attributes in the navigation menu and submenu involves making sure the components are usable by people with disabilities, including those who rely on keyboard navigation and screen readers. 


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
